Final Project for Prefabulous, LLC


## Flori Mission Statement
We intrinsically revolutionize leading-edge intellectual capital so that we may endeavor to stay competitive in tomorrow's world. We strive to make an immersive, streamlined, and retro-inspired world with infinite possibilities, a remastered spiritual successor to Stardew Valley.

## About Us

Luther Burbank once said, 
>"Flowers always make people better, happier, and more helpful; they are sunshine, food and medicine for the soul."


Furthermore, Webster's Dictionary defines Flori as:
> Flori: An authentic, *visceral* gardening experience in VIRTUAL REALITY.

## Team Rules

* Give your all! This is going to be awesome and, didn't we mention, visceral!

### Slack

* Update the team *every* day about work progress
* Alert the Project Manager at least *2 days* ahead if you won't be able to work on the project (assignments, family, etc...)
* Be available and responsive because we rely on each other heavily in such a small team

### Code

* Use proper styling, as defined [here](https://github.com/raywenderlich/c-sharp-style-guide)
* Declare variables with meaningful names, eg: *bool isHoldingCan;*
* Beware the Update() function! Avoid putting code in an Update() when it doesn't need to be!
* KUHO for life. Keep Unity Hierarchy Organized - follow my example in the scenes or ask for help if you need it

### Workflow

* Don't struggle alone! After 2 hours *maximum* of getting stuck on a task, reach out to the @channel for help
* Issues need to be defined with an assigned team member
* Create and work in a new test scene when developing new features

### Dev Environment

* For consistency download and use [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

### Imagination

* Never be afraid to do something crazy! We welcome any and all ideas, so dream big!

### Resources

* Join the [VRTK Slack channel](http://invite.vrtk.io)
* We're using VRTK 3.3 alpha, which gives us better functionality! Refer to the [VRTK Docs](https://vrtoolkit.readme.io/docs/) for API help and the [VRTK Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWRk-LEMUNoZxUmY1wO7DBQ) channel for tutorials
* [Google Low-Poly Library](https://poly.google.com/)

### Bi-Weekly Roles

Every 3 days, we will assign supplementary specialty roles to each team member, eg:
* VRTK Interactions Specialist - refine player controls to be as realistic as possible, as well as learn new ways of interacting with objects [**Summary Here**](https://vrtoolkit.readme.io/docs/summary-2) (sections in the left column)
* New Features Lead - develop at least one new and useful feature during your tenure
* Quality Assurance Director - test developed features and scenes for bugs, work to fix them, and optimize current mechanics. QAD will notify @channel of bugs, so the whole team can help

Teammates can keep roles for multiple sessions, but must forfeit their role to another teammate who wants it.
