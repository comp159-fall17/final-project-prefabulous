*Final Project for Prefabulous, LLC*


## Flori Mission Statement
We intrinsically revolutionize leading-edge intellectual capital so that we may endeavor to stay competitive in tomorrow's world. We strive to make an immersive, streamlined, and retro-inspired world with infinite possibilities, a remastered spiritual successor to Stardew Valley.

## About Us

Luther Burbank once said, 
>"Flowers always make people better, happier, and more helpful; they are sunshine, food and medicine for the soul."


Furthermore, Webster's Dictionary defines Flori as:
> Flori: An authentic, *visceral* gardening experience in VIRTUAL REALITY.

## Summary

Enter Flori, where the only weapon you wield is a watering can and the pureness of your heart. 
Guns? Swords? *Mini-nukes*? You won't need those here. <br>

Wander around your garden and grow the *most beautiful flowers* of all time. Sell them at the market or keep them closeby and enjoy your pristine, visceral surroundings.

## How to Play

Press down on the thumbsticks to teleport. Only when the teleport dots are green will you be able to teleport. Seeds can be planted in any of the empty pots and you may sell them or the flowers you grow in the box with this logo on it:

Buy more seeds from the little pouches on the Market Wall and don't forget to check your piggy bank for how much money you have! 

Now get going! The adventure awaits!

## Team Rules

* Give your all! This is going to be awesome and, didn't we mention, visceral!

### Slack

* Update the team *every* day about work progress
* Alert the Project Manager at least *2 days* ahead if you won't be able to work on the project (assignments, family, etc...)
* Be available and responsive because we rely on each other heavily in such a small team

### Code

* Use proper styling, as defined [here](https://github.com/raywenderlich/c-sharp-style-guide)
* Declare variables with meaningful names, eg: *bool isHoldingCan;*
* Beware the Update() function! Avoid putting code in an Update() when it doesn't need to be!
* KUHO for life. Keep Unity Hierarchy Organized - follow my example in the scenes or ask for help if you need it

### Workflow

* Don't struggle alone! After 2 hours *maximum* of getting stuck on a task, reach out to the @channel for help
* Issues need to be defined with an assigned team member
* Create and work in a new test scene when developing new features

### Dev Environment

* For consistency download and use [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

### Imagination

* Never be afraid to do something crazy! We welcome any and all ideas, so dream big!

### Resources

* Join the [VRTK Slack channel](http://invite.vrtk.io)
* We're using VRTK 3.3 alpha, which gives us better functionality! Refer to the [VRTK Docs](https://vrtoolkit.readme.io/docs/) for API help and the [VRTK Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWRk-LEMUNoZxUmY1wO7DBQ) channel for tutorials
* [Google Low-Poly Library](https://poly.google.com/)
* Check out the [Flori 3D Zip](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ptpzdqdmo9uxf5p/Flori.zip?dl=0) for reference

### Bi-Weekly Roles

Every 3 days, we will assign supplementary specialty roles to each team member, eg:
* VRTK Interactions Specialist - refine player controls to be as realistic as possible, as well as learn new ways of interacting with objects [**Summary Here**](https://vrtoolkit.readme.io/docs/summary-2) (sections in the left column)
* New Features Lead - develop at least one new and useful feature during your tenure
* Quality Assurance Director - test developed features and scenes for bugs, work to fix them, and optimize current mechanics. QAD will notify @channel of bugs, so the whole team can help

Teammates can keep roles for multiple sessions, but must forfeit their role to another teammate who wants it.
